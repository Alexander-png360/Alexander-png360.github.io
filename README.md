## About Me

I have experience in C++ programming, 3D modeling, and game development. I enjoy creating efficient and creative solutions, and I’m always looking to challenge myself with new projects.

I have about **3** years of solid practice modeling, texturing and rigging, and about **1.5** years in unreal engine with blueprint, hoping to learn C++ outside of unreal to build apps and expand my horizons
